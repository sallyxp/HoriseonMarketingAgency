# Project: Horiseon Main Page

## Description 

This project is to introduce the Marketing agency Horiseon onto the net.  This introductory page is intended to be the first page that is seen when visiting the site.  It shows briefly the company's various roles, accessed by links at the top of the webpage. 

This is the first project whilst on the course.  Consequently it is only intended as an introduction to the agency Horiseon.  However the links should all be working and the screen should fit and be without errors since it is the online window to the company.
